# Efficacy of the RAPTOR Statistic

The NBA statistic "RAPTOR" stands for **R**obust **A**lgorithm (using) **P**layer **T**racking (and) **O**n/**O**ff **R**atings. This is a plus/minus statistic that measures a player’s point contribution to his team based on offensive and defensive contributions per 100 possessions. There are two major components when calculating a player’s RAPTOR score. The first component is the “box” component which uses a player’s individual statistics. The second component is the “on-off” component which evaluates a team’s performance when the player and combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor. As a descriptive statistic, RAPTOR is calculated solely based on a player’s on-court performance and the performance of the player’s teammates.

The research question to answer is "What effect do different categories of statistics have on NBA's newly implemented RAPTOR score." We decided to explore this research question because of the interest in how data analytics works in the sports industry (specifically the NBA) and to analyze the NBA with a statistical business perspective rather than an entertainment perspective. Python was used to read and merge the datasets from _NBAStuffer_ and _FiveThirtyEight_,



The main beneficiaries of this project are sports managers and coaches. General team managers can use the model’s results to see which players to recruit or trade while coaches can see which game strategy to use. For example, team managers would want to sign certain players that are determined to bring the most value to the team. As for coaches, they can decide on a certain style of play or determine which players to give more playing time. Other groups that would benefit include stakeholders and gamblers. Stakeholders and gamblers can use these models to see which team to invest their money in before the season even starts.
