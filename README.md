# Efficacy of the RAPTOR Statistic

The NBA statistic "RAPTOR" stands for **R**obust **A**lgorithm (using) **P**layer **T**racking (and) **O**n/**O**ff **R**atings.

The research question to answer is "What effect do different categories of statistics have on NBA's newly implemented RAPTOR score." We decided to explore this research question because of the interest in how data analytics works in the sports industry (specifically the NBA) and to analyze the NBA with a statistical business perspective rather than an entertainment perspective. 



The main beneficiaries of this project are sports managers and coaches. General team managers can use the modelâ€™s results to see which players to recruit or trade while coaches can see which game strategy to use. For example, team managers would want to sign certain players that are determined to bring the most value to the team. As for coaches, they can decide on a certain style of play or determine which players to give more playing time. Other groups that would benefit include stakeholders and gamblers. Stakeholders and gamblers can use these models to see which team to invest their money in before the season even starts.
